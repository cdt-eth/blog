I recap of 2 coding challeneges I completed.

### 01 - React: Username Validation

**Prompt:** _Create input box, user adds a username that must be minimum of 4 characters long and unique. To verify itâ€™s unique, I had to hit an API that checked it against their database and returned true vs. false._

My full answer is at the bottom, but I wanted to break down my thoughts as well.

After setting up the project locally, via git, I upgraded the React & React DOM version from `v16.x` to `v17` so that I could use Hooks. I then changed the class component to a functional one and imported `{ useState }`. Then I set up the state I would need. I knew I would need the `username` that the user would input. I also knew I would need the state of whether a username was taken or not. I called it `taken` and I knew we'd be getting back a boolean value, `true` or `false`. I set the state of each to an empty string.

```javascript
const [taken, setTaken] = useState("")
const [username, setUsername] = useState("")
```

Next, I created the `form` in JSX. I started with a wrapped `div` with a simple margin style prop so I can visually see better and not smushed up against the corners of the DOM. So the `form` will have a `handleSubmit` method. Then I created a label for some instructions. Then two `input` fields. One input field of and another button. The first `input` field had the standed `type=text` to define what input we're expecting, and I bound the value of the field to the `username` from our `useState` hook. Then, the `onChange` method that has had the `setUsername` `useState` function to take the input value the user inputs and we're setting that equal to our the state of `username`. Lastly, the submit input is `type=submit` to define its a button type and that's it.

```javascript
<div
  style={{
    margin: 20,
  }}
>
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    <br />
    <label>
      Input Username:{" "}
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="enter username"
        value={username}
        onChange={e => {
          setUsername(e.target.value)
        }}
      />
    </label>

    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
  </form>
</div>
```

So to the meat. Our `handleSubmit` function is where "everything" happens. First, we call `preventDefault` on our `e` (event). Since forms, by default, submit POST requests, they will reload the page, but we don't use a form for this purpose. Therefore, we want to **_prevent_** it's **_default_** behavior. We'll use our form button to fetch data and therefore don't want our page to reload. Moving on, we do our username validation. The requirements were to check if the `username` was at least 4 characters long. So we're error checking for the opposite. So, with our conditional operator, we say "if there's a `username` AND said length `username` is LESS THAN 4 (characters) then we'll `console.error` our descriptive error message letting our user know that said `username` doesn't meet the given criteria.

```javascript
function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault()

  if (username && username.length < 4) {
    console.error("ERROR:Username must be at least 4 characters long")
  }
```

Within our `handleSubmit` function we have an asynchronous fetch function that waits for data back from our API. I used string interpolation to dynamically call the API with whatever the `state`/value of our `username` is (i.e. the username the user input).

We then await our response and call `.json()` which we use to [extract a JSON object from the response data](https://dev.to/kishore007k/using-fetch-with-async-await-54od). This returns a Javascript `Promise` so that's why we have to `await` it. I then clean up the code by creating a variable for the nested data and then I assign the boolen value to a `string`. We're ultimately returning `true` or `false` so to display it, it must be a string. I call the Javscript method `.toString()` on the boolean value and then assign it to `state` using our `setTaken()` hook.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://hxj1tck8l1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/users/taken?username=${username}`
  )

  const data = await response.json()
  const result = data.taken

  const strResult = result.toString()

  console.log(strResult)
  setTaken(strResult)
}
```

Then, below the function body, we call our async `fetchData` function, and then we'll reset our `username` value in the input field back to an empty string. This does two things, one it will visually reset the field value in the DOM which indicates to the user that they can search again, and secondly, it resets the value in our hook to be ready to receive a new value upon next submit.

```javascript
fetchData()
setUsername("")
```

Below our form, I added this JSX element. It does two things. This is a conditional rendering block. So it will check for the state of taken (i.e. Do we have `taken` state? Is `taken` truthy?). So IF `taken` is true THEN (that's what the `&&` is doing, conditionally checking for the left side to then render the right side) display the `taken` state in an `<h3>` tag. This will display "True" if the `username` that the username IS TAKEN (i.e. not valid) or "False" if the `username` is not taken (i.e. free to use).

```javascript
{
  taken && <h3>{taken}</h3>
}
```

#### Full Code

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react"

export default function App() {
  const [taken, setTaken] = useState("")
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("")

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault()

    if (username && username.length < 4) {
      console.error("ERROR:Username must be at least 4 characters long")
    }

    async function fetchData() {
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://hxj1tck8l1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/users/taken?username=${username}`
      )

      const data = await response.json()
      const result = data.taken

      const strResult = result.toString()

      console.log(strResult)
      setTaken(strResult)
    }

    fetchData()
    setUsername("")
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        margin: 20,
      }}
    >
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <br />
        <label>
          Input Username:{" "}
          <input
            type="text"
            placeholder="enter username"
            value={username}
            onChange={e => {
              setUsername(e.target.value)
            }}
          />
        </label>

        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>

      {taken && <h3>{taken}</h3>}
    </div>
  )
}
```
