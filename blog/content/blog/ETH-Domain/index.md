**OVERVIEW** <br/>
I recently bought my first .eth domain. You can [watch an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH0xg66vD6o) with Nick Johnson, lead developer of ENS (Ethereum Naming Service), on the [Crypto Native Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/c/FutureAlisha/videos).

<h3>Where</h3>

On the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), more specifically at [app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains/). ENS is a decentralized domain name registry.

First, I needed Ethereum. You can't buy an .eth domain with your debit card or Apple Pay. You'll need crypto. So I tried out the [Rainbow wallet](https://rainbow.me/) because I heard great things on Twitter about ease-of-use and onboarding. I was able to use Apple Pay to buy Eth, and from there I connected my wallet to ENS and was able to purchase my .eth domain.

You can [watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jssRnV5Ob6A) by Nader Dabit showing how to buy an .eth domain if you prefer a visual guide to doing so.

<h3>Why</h3>

_**Signaling**_<br/>
As a developer, this is a simple way to signal to the community at large that I'm "on board" and willing & eager to dive deeper into the community. Something as easy as setting your Twitter name to your .eth domain is a simple way to let others know your interests and can open a door or start a conversation. <br/><br/>

_**Simplicity**_<br/>
You can send ETH or NFTs directly to someone, via Rainbow.me for example, by just having their .eth domain name. <br/><br/>

_**Cheap (for now)**_<br/>
Just like with traditional domains, you want to get in sooner than later. If possible you want just your first name, if not your full name, etc etc. Nowadays, it impossible to get "your name" on Gmail, Twitter, domains etc. So when a new<br/><br/>
