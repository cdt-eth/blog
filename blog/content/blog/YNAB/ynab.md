I'm starting this year by budgeting with [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com), and it does take some time to get used to it. It's a zero-based budgeting tool and that means that every dollar has a home. Every dollar in your bank account is allocated for and will have a job. There's no money just chilling in your bank and waiting to get frivously spent on fast food. You start by declaring all your categories ahead of time and then linking your banks and credit cards. Then you allocated _*only the money you have*_ until your balance hits zero. Then you follow that plan. So you're not budgeting too far into the future and you're not budgeting money you _don't_ have because you literally *don't* have it yet. That's a big part of zero-based budgeting.
